# SONIC BOTS UPDATE HISTORY

## FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY'S MUSIC BOTS

### TUTORIAL VIDEO REUPLOADED - September 22nd, 2023
I have decided to delete the Glamrock Bonnie Bot channel since I feel like the channel would be useless. That means I have decided to reupload the tutorial video for @Bonnie Bot and @Chica Bot on my Sonic the Werehog channel since that channel has the community tab (somehow): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AGGrKB56E0

### BOT COMING SOON - August 4th, 2023
Currently working on @Bonnie Bot and @Chica Bot which will be a remake of @Boomerang Mario Five Nights at Freddy's music bots. We are working on making the bots more nicer as well as having more playable Five Nights at Freddy's music that can be played in your voice channel.
I made a youtube channel for the bot since @Boomerang Mario google account is suspended: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ6ATcJQ7q_43PtYL-N0OVg

## SONIC MUSIC BOTS

### SONIC.EXE STUFF MERGED TO SONIC BOTS - November 24th, 2023
Hello, for those who don't know. I did have a SHADOW.EXE bot that had .EXE images and scary songs. Howevr, I have thought about this and have decided to merge SHADOW.EXE's features to Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the Werehog, and Shadow the Knight. I also have deleted the SHADOW.EXE bot in order for me to focus on the Sonic the Hedgehog bots.

Here are the things that I have added to the bot.
Added 3 songs to the bot (from the SHADOW.EXE bot): hilact1, pegasusdevice, and thisishalloween
Added 2 new commands: exepic and silverpic
Added 1 other an additional song: undefeatable which plays Undefeatable from Sonic Frontiers.

### TUTORIAL VIDEO - May 30th, 2023
If you need help operating our Sonic the Hedgehog bot, Sonic the Werehog bot, or Shadow the Knight bot, I have made a tutorial video on how to use the sonic soundboard system on my extra Youtube channel that I have. Video link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxBYo6yL5EQ

### BOT UPDATES - October 13th, 2023
Hello. After 4 months of not saying anything about the bots. I am here to discuss a few announcements with our bots.

So if you are wondering why Metal Sonic/Blaze the Cat is Sonic the Werehog, this is so this can appeal to more audiences. Don't worry. Nothing will change in terms of its functionality. However, the prefix is now changed from ms! to sw!. Also the orignal Sonic the Werehog bot has been deleted. If you want Sonic the Werehog in your server, then you will need @Sonic the Werehog. Another reasoning for this is so we do not have to host a ton of discord bots but if this is a high demand, I will provide more Sonic Music Bots.
WE ARE STILL USING REPLIT UNFORTUNITLY. No updates on when we will use a better hosting provider.

HERE IS MORE UPDATES I WANT TO SAY:
- So @Sonic the Werehog's prefix will be sw!
- Don't have @Sonic the Werehog? You may use this link to invite it: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=823697477374050305&permissions=0&scope=bot
- Updated the Website: https://sonicdiscordbot.weebly.com/ to fit with this update. Will update the Github and Docs later
- Speaking of Github, if you are from russia and can't access the website, here is an alternative to see the Music Codes: https://github.com/SonicTheDev/SonicBotsDocs
- If you have not seen ⁠server-announcements, We now have Russian support. If you wish for Support in russian, use ⁠russian-support 
- New Songs are being added to the bots.

Thats all I want to say, enjoy your Day/Night

### May 18th, 2022
I am excited to share some updates that is going on with our bots.
- The Song Codes URL is NOW https://sonicdiscordbot.weebly.com/about.html so if you have the old url bookmarked, you may want to change that
- ALL bots have one privacy policy is located at: https://sonicdiscordbot.weebly.com/sonic-privacy.html

Enjoy you day/evening/morning/night.
